E-Commerce App :

An Android application designed, customized, and developed for a medium scale enterprise, using Java, Xml and other external libraries used for enhancing design.
I have used Cloud Firebase for authentication, database and storage purpose of the media of user as well as of the company's products.
Along with this, I have integrated Paytm for payments and Fast2Sms service for sending OPT, Order Id and other details to the customer. 

Customers using this app have the features such as :
    - Login /Signin using phone number and email 
    - Update Personal Information such as address, their company profile, addresses etc. 
    - Accessing different categories of products. 
    - Viewing products their images, description, ratings, etc. 
    - Rate the products and average rating system.  (Design inspired by Google Play Store) 
    - Adding/Removing products to wishlist.  (Design inspired by Myntra) 
    - Adding/Removing products from cart. 
    - Place orders through different payment methods. 

This project is currently in Test Mode, there are many other features as well that will be added in future.
